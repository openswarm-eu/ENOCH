## Overview
ENOCH is a low-latency, capacitively coupled on-body communication system optimized for ultra-low-power operation. It employs off-the-shelf components and is programmed on an **Arduino Due**, making it accessible for researchers and developers interested in **body area networks (BANs)**.

This repository contains all necessary files to **replicate and extend** our implementation, including:
- Hardware schematics and PCB design files
- Arduino source code and API documentation
- Experimental setups and results

## 🛠 Hardware Setup
### Component Specifications
- **Greinacher Voltage Multiplier:** A capacitive charge-pump circuit optimized for RF signal rectification.
- **Comparator with RC Low-Pass Filter:** Dynamically adjusts thresholds to enhance noise immunity.
- **RF Switches:** ADG918 (TX/RX switching) and ADG902 (OOK modulation).
- **Arduino Due:** Serves as the processing unit for signal transmission and reception.

### PCB Design
The **hardware folder** contains:
- **Schematics** (`.sch`) and **PCB layout files** (`.pcbdoc`)
- **Gerber files** for manufacturing
- **Altium Designer project files**

Manufacturing can be done via [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/). We recommend using the **evaluation board** before transitioning to the miniaturized version.

## 💻 Software Setup
### Requirements
1. Install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
2. Download this repository
3. Connect **Arduino Due** via USB

### Compiling & Uploading
1. Open `Arduino IDE`
2. Select **Arduino Due (Programming Port)** under `Tools → Board`
3. Open `enochtx.ino` or `enochrx.ino`
4. Click `Verify (✔)` and then `Upload (⬆)`
5. Open `Serial Monitor` to view output

## 📡 ENOCH API
To use ENOCH with an **Arduino Due**, define the following pins:
```cpp
#define ENOCHTxCarrier 7     // Tx carrier frequency pin
#define ENOCHOOKSW 2         // Modulation (OOK) Switch pin
#define ENOCHRxGPIO 6        // Rx GPIO pin
#define ENOCHTxRxSwitch 8    // Switch for Tx/Rx mode
```
### Available Functions
```cpp
void Send_preamble(int cycles); // Transmit preamble
void Send_bytes(byte bytex[]);  // Send data bytes
void Read_bytes(byte load[]);   // Read received bytes
boolean checkRxStatus();        // Check channel availability
```

## ⚡ Experiments 
![ENOCH Transceiver](img/demo.png)
### 1️⃣ Single Transmitter & Receiver
- One **ENOCH board** transmits, the other receives.
- The receiver outputs data via `Serial Monitor`.
- **Evaluate packet delivery reliability** by testing different body placements (wrist, arm, ankle).

### 2️⃣ Multi-Node Contention
- Multiple nodes attempt to transmit simultaneously.
- A **hardware trigger button** ensures synchronized transmission.
- Transmission priority is determined by `Send_preamble(int cycles)`.
